The global company selected Jefferson County, WV, which partnered with the company to announce it had won. They then released factory design plans, followed by a public groundbreaking featuring statewide officials. This triggered aggressive community opposition that grew to 12K opponents and imperiled construction of this critical $250M plant. Company’s leaders were being verbally battered in local public meetings when ROCKWOOL approached Tigercomm for help.</p>" %}
{% set approach = "<p>Tigercomm moved quickly to help ROCKWOOL control its interface with the community by reframing the project as an economic conversation among local residents. We helped the company engage supportive members of the local business community and influential, long-time residents.</p><p>The effort was underpinned by a Facebook strategy that grew supporters’ ranks, boosted their presence in the debate, and pushed back on over-the-top opponents’ rhetoric, which included a bomb threat.</p>" %}
{% set results = "<ul><li>The factory opened on time, and it now employs 150 people who earn 25 percent above the prevailing local wages.</li><li>It’s producing eco-friendly, infinitely recyclable insulation in a state that ranks 49th for energy efficiency – in a country that wastes 40% of all the electricity it produces.</li></ul>" %}
