{% set challenge = "<p>As for most global companies, the pandemic disrupted supply chains for Nextracker, the world’s leading maker of solar trackers and software. CEO Dan Shugar saw early that the cost of sluggish supply chains outweighed savings from manufacturing in China. He leaned into the challenge, aggressively reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. before the Inflation Reduction Act incentivized others. The company was leading the way, but few outside it knew that – an unfilled opportunity as the company prepared to go public in February 2023.</p>" %}
{% set approach = "<p>Tigercomm helped Nextracker design and execute a series of high-profile reshoring events at 19 locations around America over a two-year period. Shugar emceed his events, which emphasized Nextracker’s partnerships with local manufacturers while growing the company’s contacts with state officials – and even U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Tigercomm continuously pitched targeted national media and cleantech influencers on the growing numbers behind Shugar’s reshoring successes, expanding his national platform as his LinkedIn followership increased to over 20K.</p>" %}
