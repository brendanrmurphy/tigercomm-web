{% set approach = "<p>Lightsource bp asked Tigercomm to work with its development team to capture, advance and memorialize a set of best practices that fit with the company’s brand. We ran an extensive due diligence process, including interviewing over 10 staff members on current versus desired practices, and an in-depth review of 15 past community engagement efforts. The results were crafted into a customized playbook that built on current practices and advanced them to match changing dynamics in local communities and the company’s resources and risk tolerance.</p><p>At the same time, we designed and helped Lightsource bp execute a series of thought leadership pieces on its <a href='https://lightsourcebp.com/us/news/the-responsible-solar-approach-part-1-emerging-best-practices/' target='_blank'>Responsible Solar</a> development approach, as well <a href='https://lightsourcebp.com/us/news/the-responsible-solar-approach-part-1-emerging-best-practices/' target='_blank'>energy storage</a> and <a href='https://lightsourcebp.com/us/news/energy-buyer-guide-part-1-what-is-the-best-way-to-buy-clean-energy/' target='_blank'>procurement</a>.
