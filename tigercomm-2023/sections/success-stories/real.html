{% set challenge = "<p>As the Massachusetts legislature prepared to expand state commitments to climate progress, it also considered <em>banning</em> retail sales of 100% clean energy – effectively pushing Bay Staters back into the arms of incumbent, monopoly utilities. Several retailers formed the <a href='https://www.retailenergychoice.org/' target='_blank'>Retail Energy Advancement League</a> (REAL), but were hampered by differences on messaging and how much risk to take. The ban was backed by the popular, then-Attorney General Maura Healey (who led the race for governor by 44 points). A combined tens of millions in sales was at severe risk for nearly a dozen retailers.</p>" %}
{% set approach = "<p>REAL tasked Tigercomm with designing the market defense effort. Our due diligence revealed the entire issue had gotten little attention, and its obscurity was advantageous if REAL would explain and define its benefits. We saw retail clean energy was popular (72% in an industry poll). It was an incumbent reality, with <a href='https://www.retailenergychoice.org/massachusetts-lawmakers-remove-proposed-ban-on-competitive-electric-market-from-climate-bill/' target='_blank'>almost half a million Bay State households</a> already using such services.</p><p>We helped REAL position itself as defending Bay Staters’ right to retail savings from “politicians’ attempt to take away” homeowners’ right to buy clean energy. To elevate the issue despite shrinking local news, we secured cleantech trade media coverage (<a href='https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/12/massachusetts-bill-would-eliminate-clean-energy-choice/' target='_blank'>here</a> and <a href='https://www.utilitydive.com/news/massachusetts-energy-bills-retail-competition/627381/' target='_blank'>here</a>) to cover the issue, then used that coverage in advertising targeting existing customers.</p><p>The ad campaign triggered a flood of signers on a petition to the legislature expressing concerns about the proposed ban.</p>" %}
