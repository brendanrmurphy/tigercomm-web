{% set challenge = '<p>As more Americans installed solar panels on their roofs, many utilities began to see the trend as a direct threat to their monopoly dominance over electricity sales.

These powerful companies began to attack homeowners’ ability to sell power back to the grid at the same price as the utility sold them power.

It even triggered a federal criminal probe into influence peddling on that state’s utility commission, and it forced the resignation of the commission’s chairwoman.</li><li>In Nevada, the commissioner who attacked residential solar on behalf of the dominant utility had to resign when his conduct was exposed.</li><li>SolarCity’s then-CEO Lydon Rives said that our efforts had saved his company half a billion dollars of market capitalization by blocking efforts by the utilities to effectively impose new taxes on solar homeowners in three states.</li></ul>' %}
