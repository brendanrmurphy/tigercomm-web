{% set challenge = "<p>When renewable energy deployment started scaling, the oil and gas industry wanted to erode its support among the statewide officials witnessing renewables’ growth. Industry associations wanted to head off a loss of Congressional support as they sought to win long-term extensions of vital tax credits for wind and solar. The then-American Wind Energy Association’s C3 arm, A Renewable America (ARA), asked Tigercomm to help devise and run the approach.</p>" %}
{% set approach = "<p>We worked with ARA to use association membership rosters to identify owners of local clean energy businesses who wanted to talk about their positive impact on local economies. Using the latest digital targeting and profiling technology, we developed an online advertising campaign that saturated select policy makers and their support networks (from local media, businesses and government to broader community organizations) in eight states. The videos featured compelling testimonials and stories from renewable energy/supply chain business voices about clean energy companies as local and mainstream business job creators.</p>" %}
{% set results = "<ul><li>Produced 18, 30-second videos across 8 states</li>
<li>Received 842,252 video views (128% of original goal)</li><li>Achieved very high view-through rate of 72%</li><li>Then-U.S. Senator Dean Heller (NV) switched from being a renewables skeptic to champion </li></ul>" %}
