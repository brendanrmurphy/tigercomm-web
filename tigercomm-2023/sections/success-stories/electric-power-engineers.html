{% set challenge = "<p>Electric Power Engineers (EPE) is a leading engineering consultancy. The firm had created an AI-based software offering, and spun off the division that sold it, ENERi-AI, shortly before the major annual trade show RE+. The company wanted to accelerate its organic growth by boosting customer traffic at its trade show booth, but the spinoff had no brand presence. With weeks to go before the trade show, EPE CEO Hala Ballouz asked Tigercomm to help jump-start its customer outreach.</p>" %}
{% set approach = "<p>In just three weeks, Tigercomm helped the company set booth traffic goals for the show, refine its sales targets, message the new product, and set up an initial website to handle inbound leads. We then developed an outreach strategy on LinkedIn that featured three company leaders, who we media trained, and were backed by digital ads tightly targeting sales prospects.</p>" %}
{% set results = "<p>The company doubled its booth traffic goals, resulting in almost 40 qualified leads.</p>" %}
