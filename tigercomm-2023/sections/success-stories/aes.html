{% set challenge = '<p>Global energy company AES had achieved strong ties with the local community around the largest wind farm in Arizona. The company wanted to cement its relationships with local and state officials through an in-person event that would celebrate a major construction milestone and attract local media attention. But the event’s remote location – Winslow, four hours outside of Phoenix – and summer temperatures posed significant challenges. And safety concerns prohibited the company from offering media a trip to the top of the iconic turbines.</p>' %}
{% set approach = '<p>Tigercomm selected and managed the event vendor, oversaw the design and run-of-show, and ensured local supporters had a significant role. We also worked with AES to message the event to make it inviting to state officials, and we ensured the media had a bus tour of the sprawling project that spanned lands from two counties.</p>' %}
{% set results = '<ul><li>The event’s compelling message of local support and economic development drew local community leaders, the chairman of the state public utility commission, and Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs. AES executives had a forum to strengthen their ties to all of these key constituencies.</li><li>Despite the distances involved, the state’s leading newspaper and a major Phoenix television station covered the event in person.</li></ul>' %}
