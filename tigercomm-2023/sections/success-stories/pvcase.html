In the weeks before Intersolar Europe, the continent’s biggest solar trade show, PVcase needed to frame the benefit of the acquisition to customers while helping it cement an important round of funding…on its own terms.</p>' %}
{% set approach = '<p>Tigercomm used its industry-leading message development process to help the company frame the acquisition and the problem it solved for developers: The loss of data integrity resulting from moving designs from one niche software design platform to another. We counseled the company to coin this problem “data risk,” and to determine the time saved when data risk was addressed. PVcase was able to calculate and tout that more-consolidated design software could cut project design from weeks to 20 minutes. Tigercomm media trained company leaders and then helped them deploy their new skills in an announcement video geared to customers who’d be attending the trade show.</p>' %}
